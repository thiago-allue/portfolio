Vagrant for Windows Procedures

Follow these procedures only if you want to use Vagrant with Windows.

1. Download the software
Download the latest Virtualbox from https://www.virtualbox.org/
Download the latest Vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com/
Download putty and puttygen from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/...
2. Convert the vagrant private key
Using puttygen you downloaded from the putty website, convert the OpenSSH private key to a putty-readable key:

Make sure your vagrant box is running (vagrant up in project folder)
Type the command vagrant ssh-config to display the ssh configuration. You can find the path to the private key next to IdentityFile
Open puttygen
Click on the Load button
Navigate to the path shown by vagrant ssh-config (next to IdentityFile)
Select the private_key
Now click on the “Save private key” button and save the file as .ppk file somewhere where you can easily find it
3. Use putty to log into your Vagrant machines
Open putty and configure the following parameters:

Session:
Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: 2222 and up (depends on how many vagrant machines you launch)
Connection
Data
Auto-login username: vagrant
Connection/SSH
Auth
Private key file for authentication: Click on browse and select your ppk file
Session
Save the session to save the parameters you just entered
4. Alternatives
You can also use the login/password combination “vagrant” / “vagrant”, but then you will have to enter it manually every time
When configuring vagrant in the next lectures, I’ll often use a private IP address. You can use this private IP address with port 22 instead of 127.0.0.1:2222
